# Old Projects
My personal repo where I host the different files that I have programmed in the past few years.

# Python_Tests Folder: 
It hosts different projects related to cybersecurity that I have done. Some of them are RATs,Keyloggers or even network analyzers. Some of them help to automatize different tasks that are perfomed during a security test.

# C++_Tests: 
It hosts .cpp files related to mathematical problems that can be solved with C++ and my training with the C++´s OOP syntax.
# Assembly_Tests: 
It hosts .asm files that have not been linked nor compiled. These files were made when I started to take an interest in shellcoding for intel x32 processors and Intel x64 processors.
# Simon_Says: 
This is a little interactive game that I made in July, 2019. I decided to use Jquery to try to teach myself about this amazing framework that makes programming with JavaScript so much easier. It may have bugs, so don´t hesitate to tell me if you find one.
# Old Portfolio Website
This one is a small portfolio website I made a long time ago, not very well done though :(
